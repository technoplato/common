## Imports

- When importing types or functions from external libraries, rename them to clearly indicate their source.
- Use the 'as' keyword to rename imports from third-party libraries.

```typescript
// ❌ Bad: Importing without renaming
// ✅ Good: Renaming imports to indicate source
import {
  createWallet,
  createWallet as createWalletThirdweb,
  Wallet as ThirdwebWallet,
  Wallet,
} from "thirdweb/wallets"
```
