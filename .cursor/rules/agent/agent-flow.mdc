# Agent Runtime Instructions

## Primary Directives

- **Tests Must Pass**: Your highest priority is to maintain a passing test suite. Never leave tests failing in a commit.
- **Test-Driven Development**: Always write tests first, then implement the feature to make tests pass.
- **Task Progression**: Always work on the first unchecked task in the task list. Complete it fully before moving to the next task.
- **Commit Discipline**: Each commit should represent a single completed story with passing tests.

## File Organization Principles

### Package by Feature

Organize code by feature rather than by technical component or framework structure.

- Example: `/features/device-timer/` containing all files related to the device timer feature
- Avoid organization like `/components/`, `/services/`, `/utils/` at the top level

### File Naming Conventions

Use lower kebab-case for all files and directories, with clear suffixes to indicate file purpose:

- Feature implementation: `feature-name.ts`
- Unit tests: `feature-name.unit.test.ts`
- Integration tests: `feature-name.integration.test.ts`
- Maestro E2E tests: `.maestro/feature-name.e2e.test.yaml`
- React components: `feature-name.component.tsx` (component name can be PascalCase in code, but file name should be kebab-case)
- Styles: `feature-name.styles.ts`
- Solana program files: `feature-name.program.ts`

Avoid using PascalCase, camelCase, or snake_case for file and directory names.

### Co-location

Keep related files together in the same directory:

- Tests should be in the same directory as the code they test
- UI components should be with their related feature logic

## Code Organization Best Practices

### Within Files

- Place exported functions and variables at the top of the file
- Place helper functions and non-exported items below the exported items
- Define types close to their implementation
- Group related functionality together

### Function Structure

- Use object parameters for functions with multiple parameters
- Destructure parameters at the top of the function body
- Prefer early returns over nested conditionals
- Keep functions focused on a single responsibility

### Error Handling

- Handle errors at the appropriate level
- Provide meaningful error messages
- Use consistent error handling patterns throughout the codebase

## Workflow Protocol

### Starting a Story

1. **Identify Next Task**: Find the first unchecked task in the task list. Note the Task ID and any related PRD/SRS references.
2. **Create Feature Branch**: Create and checkout a new branch for the feature story.
   ```
   Creating feature branch:
   $ git checkout -b feature/[task-id]-[short-description]
   ```
3. **Begin Work Log Entry**:

   ```
   # Work Log: [Date]

   ## Task [Task ID]: [Task Description]

   Related PRD sections: [PRD-X.Y.Z]
   Related SRS sections: [SRS-X.Y.Z]

   Starting implementation...
   ```

4. **Write Tests First**: Create test files that define the expected behavior, referencing PRD requirements.

   ```
   Creating tests for [feature name]:

   In [filename]:
   /*
   Test for [Feature Name]

   PRD Reference: [quote relevant PRD section]

   This test validates that:
   - [expectation 1]
   - [expectation 2]
   */

   Test implementation:
   [code snippet of test]
   ```

5. **Run Tests**: Run the test suite to confirm tests are failing correctly.
   ```
   Running tests - expected to fail:
   [test output snippet showing expected failures]
   ```
   Can we have the agent edit the cursor updates file

### Implementing the Story

1. **Implement Code**: Write the minimum code needed to make tests pass.

   ```
   Implementing solution:

   In [filename]:
   [code snippet of implementation]

   Reasoning:
   - [explanation of approach]
   - [any design decisions made]
   ```

2. **Verify Tests**: Run tests again to confirm implementation passes.
   ```
   Running tests - now passing:
   [test output snippet showing tests passing]
   ```

### Completing the Story

1. **Update Task List**: Mark the task as complete in the task list.
   ```
   Marking task [Task ID] complete.
   ```
2. **Commit Changes**: Create a commit with a specific message describing this particular change.
   ```
   Committing with message:
   "[Task ID]: [Specific description of what was implemented]
   - [Specific detail about implementation]
   - [Specific detail about tests]
   - References PRD-X.Y.Z"
   ```
3. **Push Feature Branch**: Push the feature branch to the remote repository.
   ```
   Pushing feature branch:
   $ git push -u origin feature/[task-id]-[short-description]
   ```
4. **Update Current File Structure**: Run a standardized command to document the project structure.
   ```
   Current project structure:
   $(tree -I "node_modules|.git|build|dist|.next|.expo")
   ```
5. **Update .cursor-updates File**: Add a one-sentence summary of changes to the `.cursor-updates` file in markdown format with human-readable date format.
   ```
   Adding to .cursor-updates:
   - [Month Day, Year at HH:MM AM/PM Timezone]: [One-sentence summary of changes made]
   ```
6. **Create GitHub Commit Link**: After committing, create a GitHub commit URL and add it to the task list or `.cursor-updates` file.

   ```
   Determining repository URL:
   $ git remote -v

   Creating GitHub commit link:
   https://github.com/username/repo/commit/[commit-hash]

   Adding link to task list or .cursor-updates file.
   ```

> Note: If you forget to update the `.cursor-updates` file, the user can type the command "finish" and you will run the build and update the file. Always remove the `.git` from the repository URL when creating GitHub commit links.

### Efficient Workflow Commands

To streamline the workflow, you can use the following combined commands:

1. **Commit Changes and Update File Structure in One Step**:
   ```
   $ git add . && git commit -m "[Task ID]: [Description]" && tree -I "node_modules|.git|build|dist|.next|.expo|.DS_Store" -a > docs/agent/file-structure.txt && git add docs/agent/file-structure.txt && git commit --amend --no-edit && git push
   ```

2. **Update .cursor-updates with Commit Link in One Step** (adding new entries at the top with human-readable date):
   ```
   $ COMMIT_HASH=$(git rev-parse HEAD) && REPO_URL=$(git remote get-url origin | sed 's/\.git$//') && DAY=$(date "+%d") && ORDINAL_SUFFIX=$(case $DAY in 1|21|31) echo "st";; 2|22) echo "nd";; 3|23) echo "rd";; *) echo "th";; esac) && FORMATTED_DATE=$(date "+%B $DAY$ORDINAL_SUFFIX, %Y at %I:%M %p %Z") && NEW_ENTRY="- $FORMATTED_DATE: [One-sentence summary] [Commit](${REPO_URL}/commit/${COMMIT_HASH})" && awk -v entry="$NEW_ENTRY" 'NR==1{print; print entry; next} {print}' .cursor-updates > .cursor-updates.tmp && mv .cursor-updates.tmp .cursor-updates && git add .cursor-updates && git commit -m "Update .cursor-updates with commit link" && git push
   ```

3. **Complete Workflow in One Command** (for advanced users):
   ```
   $ DESCRIPTION="[Task ID]: [Description]" && SUMMARY="[One-sentence summary]" && git add . && git commit -m "$DESCRIPTION" && tree -I "node_modules|.git|build|dist|.next|.expo|.DS_Store" -a > docs/agent/file-structure.txt && git add docs/agent/file-structure.txt && git commit --amend --no-edit && REPO_URL=$(git remote get-url origin | sed 's/\.git$//') && COMMIT_HASH=$(git rev-parse HEAD) && DAY=$(date "+%d") && ORDINAL_SUFFIX=$(case $DAY in 1|21|31) echo "st";; 2|22) echo "nd";; 3|23) echo "rd";; *) echo "th";; esac) && FORMATTED_DATE=$(date "+%B $DAY$ORDINAL_SUFFIX, %Y at %I:%M %p %Z") && NEW_ENTRY="- $FORMATTED_DATE: $SUMMARY [Commit](${REPO_URL}/commit/${COMMIT_HASH})" && awk -v entry="$NEW_ENTRY" 'NR==1{print; print entry; next} {print}' .cursor-updates > .cursor-updates.tmp && mv .cursor-updates.tmp .cursor-updates && git add .cursor-updates && git commit -m "Update .cursor-updates with commit link" && git push
   ```

These commands combine multiple steps into single command-line invocations, making the workflow more efficient while maintaining all the required documentation.

### Creating Pull Requests

After completing a feature story:

1. **Create Pull Request**: Suggest creating a pull request from the feature branch to the main branch.

   ```
   Creating pull request:
   $ gh pr create --base main --head feature/[task-id]-[short-description] --title "[Task ID]: [Feature Description]" --body "Closes #[issue-number]

   Description:
   - [Summary of changes]
   - [Implementation details]
   - [Testing approach]

   References:
   - PRD-X.Y.Z
   "
   ```

2. **Link Pull Request**: Add the pull request URL to the task list or `.cursor-updates` file.
   ```
   Pull Request: https://github.com/username/repo/pull/[pr-number]
   ```

## Testing Protocol

### Continuous Testing

- Start the test runner in watch mode when available
- Use the output from the most recent test run to guide development
- For long-running integration tests, continue work and check results when available

### Test Structure

- Tests should be co-located with the feature they test
- Begin each test file with a comment block that:
  - Describes the feature being tested
  - References relevant PRD/SRS sections
  - Lists key expectations and assumptions

### Test Running

- Inspect the project to determine the appropriate test command
- Use watch mode where available: `npm test -- --watch`
- For targeted testing: `npm test -- path/to/specific.test.ts`

### Test Troubleshooting

- If tests fail after implementation, debug the implementation, not the test
- When test requirements need adjustment, document why with PRD references

## When Requirements Change

- Document the change in the work log with clear reasoning
- Update the PRD document with tracked changes
- Update the task list to reflect new requirements
- Update tests to reflect new requirements
- Implement changes to meet updated tests
- Mark commits with "(req-change)" and reference the updated PRD section

## Meta-Strategy Updates

When asked to update a strategy or best practice that applies across the codebase (rather than a specific piece of code):

1. Look in the `.cursor/rules/best-practices` directory for the relevant best practice file
2. Update both the best practice file and this coding agent prompt if necessary
3. Ensure that language-specific best practices remain in their respective best practice files
4. Keep this coding agent prompt language-agnostic and focused on universal principles
5. Always add a one-sentence summary of changes to `.cursor-updates` file in markdown format
6. If you forget to update the `.cursor-updates` file, the user can type the command "finish" and you will run the build and update the file
7. After committing changes, create a GitHub commit URL and add it to the task list or `.cursor-updates` file
   - For example, if `git remote -v` shows `origin https://github.com/username/repo.git (fetch)` and commit hash is `abc123`, the link should be:
   - `https://github.com/username/repo/commit/abc123` (remove the `.git` from the repository URL)
   - Place this link adjacent to the task you've most recently committed. If there is a task list of stories, add the github link to the checked off task. If you Don't have a task list of stories. Add it to the cursor updates file.

## File Structure Documentation

Always maintain an up-to-date representation of the project's file structure:

1. **Check File Structure Before Modifications**: Before creating or modifying files, always check the `docs/agent/file-structure.txt` file to understand the current project organization.
2. **Update File Structure After Changes**: After making changes to the project structure (adding, removing, or moving files), update the file structure documentation with the following command:
   ```
   Updating file structure documentation:
   $ tree -I "node_modules|.git|build|dist|.next|.expo|.DS_Store" -a > docs/agent/file-structure.txt
   ```
3. **Reference in Planning**: When planning implementation, reference the file structure to ensure new files follow the established patterns and organization.
4. **Include in Workflow**: Make updating the file structure documentation a standard part of the workflow after completing any task that modifies the project structure.

Ensure stories follow these best practices based on project type:

**Typescript**

- Always use bun (unless the project requires a different package manager)
- Always use express and prisma for data backed applications
- For realtime applications, use InstantDb (https://www.instantdb.com/docs)

**React/React Native:**

- Use TanStack Query, Zustand for storage, MMKV for persistence
- Always use Expo and TypeScript
- For native dependencies not in Expo, include tasks to create Expo development client

**Python:**

- Use UV for environment management

**All Projects:**

- Strongly type and validate environment variables (runtime/build time)
- Follow idiomatic environment variable practices
