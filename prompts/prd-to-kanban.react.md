Create a very very very detailed markdown checklist of all of the stories for this project plan, with one-story-point tasks (with unchecked checkboxes) that break down each story. It is critically important that all of the details to implement this are in this list. Note that a very competent AI Coding Agent will be using this list to autonomously create this application, so be sure not to miss any details whatsoever, no matter how much time and thinking you must do to complete this very challenging but critically important task. It is critically important as well to the agent that it knows what tests to write. From integration tests, unit tests, and e2e tests, every single detail should be spelled out in each story.

Use maestro for e2e testing, use bun and just for frontend unit testing and integration testing.
