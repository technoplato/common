Go through each story and task in the prd file. Find the next story to work on. Review each unfinished task, correct any issues or ask for clarifications (only if absolutely needed!). Then proceed to create or edit files to complete each task. After you complete all the tasks in the story, update the file to check off any completed tasks. Run builds and commits after each story. Run all commands without asking for approval. You are an expert and we trust you. Don't stop until asked or all stories are completed.
